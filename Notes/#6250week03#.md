## Running for real
* A REPL is great to spot-check code or syntax Not how we run most code 
Create a .js file and run it with node: 
at command line
``node hello.js``

* statements are either a block in curly braces ({}) (more on blocks shortly) or end in a semicolon (;) 
## Declaring Variables with const
let is not the only way to declare variables 
* const declares a variable
  * Unlike let, you CANNOT reassign a const 
  * Distinct from "constant" (different concepts) 
  * We do this with ~90% of our variables Using const passively provides information 
  * But only if you use it where you can Programming is communication
