* do not comment repeating what the code says

## HTTPS
"S" for Secure Uses public-key encryption Headers/bodies are encrypted 
Prevents reading Sender each way can be validated 
Prevents alteration 

## Basic Encryption（编码
"Ciphers" are simple encryption "Corpus" (message) is altered by applying a set of rules Decryption is applying the same rules in reverse 
ROT-13 (shift english alphabet 13 characters) "book codes" ( convert letters/words to positions on page/text of a book) 

## Public Key Essentials
A "public" key - **no secrecy** 
A "private" key - keep it secret 
One-way encryption: 
Msg + **Public** key = encrypted value that needs **private** key to read Msg + **Private** key = encrypted value that needs **public** key to read 
Notice how you need the OTHER key to decrypt 

## What it means
No shared secret - public keys are PUBLIC Messages encrypted with private key more likely to be legit You can "sign" an unencrypted message by attaching an encryption of message/message checksum using your private key 

## Browsers
Browsers maintain a list of "trusted" public keys Certificate Authorities (CA) 
HTTPS sites have a private key and a signed "Certificate" from a CA saying that key is theirs Browsers CAN be configured with a set key pair 
usually make one up for short-term use site identity validated, user identity is NOT. ...but user is trusted to be the same user over duration of browser session 


## Summary - HTTPS
* HTTP is plain-text - insecure
* HTTPS protects information **in transit** 
* HTTPS uses public key encryption 
  * one-way encryption/decryption 
  * Browsers trust a list of CAs 
    * HTTPS is only as secure as the CAs 
    * CAs validate identity w/signed "cert" 
* letsencrypt.org provides free certs 

## Login
Authenticates, possibly authorizes 
Username Password 
Send both. Per security discussion, server will compare hashed password+salt to stored salt+hash for that username. 
* A salt is a piece of random data added to a password before it is hashed and stored. 

## Option Two: Session Id
Store the data on server 
Associated it with unpredictable "key" Key secret from others Not secret from user 
Stored Data = "session" Secret key = "session id" 
Now sensitive data not changeable by user 

## Option 3: Signed Auth Token
A value that says user 
* is an identity (auth）
* can do something (authz) 
"Sign" the value using Public Key encryption 
* User sends signed value (string) Much like session id (bearer token) Not secret from user Is secret from public 
* Server can validate using a public cert 
* We trust the signer/system, not user 

## Passing the bearer token is annoying
Still sending via form/link More effort to generate dynamic HTML 
Solution: Cookies! 

## Cookies Managed by Browser
* Server sends a set-cookie header on response 
  * key=value pair 
  * Along with some options 
  * Including when it "expires" Browser saves this info 
* Browsers saves this info
* On later requests
  * Browser sends a cookie header 
    * With key=value pair 
    * Automatically Server can read this cookie 

浏览器访问服务器后, 发送的一串数据，用来识别用户身份

## Cookie Security Management
* Browsers store cookie Associate with "origin" and "path" 
  * origin = protocol + domain + port 
  * path - Don't use this, not worth it 
  * Cookies only sent to origin server requests 
* Cookies editable by user Generally use for session id only 
* Cookies end when browser closed Unless they have an Expiration Date 
  * "Remember this computer" 

## Cookie Best Practices
* Set `HttpOnly' flag Unless using with client JS 
* Set Secure flag In production 
  Dev might be done in http vs https  
* Default to soon-expiring cookies 
  Shared computers are a thing 
  Session ID is EVERYTHING 
* Set SameSite option value 
  Normally Strict 


**Express cookie example** 
```
// express "middleware", this time as an extra library
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
app.use(cookieParser());

// (skipping over other express stuff)
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  const store = req.query.store;
  if(store) {
    res.cookie('saved', store);
  }

  const saw = req.cookies.saved;
  res.send(`<p>Request had cookie "saved": ${saw}</p>`);
});
```



## Steps
* Inside new project directory: 
  npm init -y 
  npm install express
  npm install cookie-parser
* Create the server.js (or whatever you call it) file 
* run node server.js 
* go to localhost:3000 in the browser 
* use ?store=SOMEVAL at end of url to set the cookie 
* DevTools-Network-Headers to see the Set-Cookie in the response  and the Cookie in the request 
* DevTools-Application-Cookies (left) to see cookies 


Here's one library:
```
npm install uuid
const uuidv4 = require('uuid').v4;
const sid = uuidv4(); // sid common name for "session id"
```


 **UUID as session id in express** 
```
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
const sessions = {}; // Created outside a route handler
app.post('/session', (req,res) => {
  const username = req.body.username.trim();
  if (!username) { // Give better errors than this!
    res.status(400).send('username required');
    return; // don't allow redirect attempt
  } else if (username === 'dog') { // Simulating a bad password
    res.status(403).send('user account not permitted');
return; } 
  const sid = uuidv4();  // uuidv4 is from uuid module
  sessions[sid] = { username }; // Do you know why?
  res.cookie('sid', sid);
  res.redirect('/');
}); 

```

**Remove all debugging console statements and commented out code before submit!** 

# Console options
.log() is not the only option on console 
* .dir() 
* .table() 
* .assert() 
* .info(), .warn(), .error() 
* .count() 
* .timeLog(), .time(), .timeEnd() 

## Personal Tips
Use numbers if just checking "did I get here" Handles multiple checks quickly No quoting 
Create shorthand objects to label output Instead of console.log(word); 
Use ==console.log({word})==; Labels output variable 
Minimal typing, no quoting
