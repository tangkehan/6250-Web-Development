During development you can automate restarts: 
Install/use nodemon to handle server restartsNot for js-service-calls, but is part of project2 
```
nodemon server.js
```
webpack can run in "watch" mode to auto-rerun 
``npx webpack --watch``

Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) isÂ a lightweight XML-based protocol that is used for the exchange of information in decentralized, distributed application environments.

## REST
Nuanced system, often done partially 
Three Basic rules (my summary) 
* URL represents a "resource" (to interact with) 
* ==HTTP Methods are the interaction== 
  GET: Read 
  POST: Create 
  PUT: Replace 
  DELETE: Delete 
  PATCH: Update 
  HTTP Status code
* Result of resource interaction 

These match most common REST implementations 
* URL represents a "resource" to interact with 
* HTTP method is the interaction with the resource 
* HTTP Status code is interaction result 

## POST vs PUT vs PATCH
Common confusion: **Create** vs **Overwrite** vs **Update** 
* POST (create)No existing record; Create new one 
* PUT (replace)Replace existing record 
  Save nothing from existing record 
* PATCH (update) 
  Replace certain fields in the record 
  Unmentioned fields stay as-is
