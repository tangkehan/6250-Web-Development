## Terminology
**endpoint** - the url for a web service 
Still a normal URL 
Is meaningful label for humans 
**payload** - The body of request/response 
For all web requests/responses 
Not just services 

HTML forms are url-encoded by-default 

**async results must be handled async** 

## Promises
**Promises** are a way to track callbacks 
A promise object represents an async operation 
* Is **pending**, **resolved**, or **rejected** 
* Has a .then() method 
  * You pass callbacks to .then()Callbacks called when promise **resolves** 
  * If already resolved 
    * Callbacks are **queued** immediately 
    * Nothing interrupts current code 
  * If rejects 
    * .then() callback NOT called 
  
**Fetch is called with a url** 
**Fetch returns a promise** 


## Errors by Status code
Some services return *meaningful* HTTP Status codes 
Like REST services (more later) 
* **2xx** status codes === Success Not an error
* **3xx** === Redirection (not really errors?) Rare for service calls 
* **4xx** === Client Caused Errors 
* **5xx** === Server Errors May be more detail in the body 
Body may have its own structure (JSON?)
