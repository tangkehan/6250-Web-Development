**require** 是运行时调用，所以理论上可以运作在代码的任何地方
**import** 是编译时调用，所以必须放在文件的开头

## Express
A **framework** to help write webservers in NodeJS "framework" 
Creates app IF code follows rules/structure One of many webserver frameworks 
A commonly used one Fairly "low-level" 
Your code close to what sent to browser We use it to see what webservers do 



Package-lock.json is used to make sure whoever run the code, it guarantee the package version would be the same

## Semver parts
**MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** 
**Major version** is an API-breaking change Or *likely* breaking change 
**Minor version** is a new feature No breaking changes 
**Patch version** is a bug/security fix No breaking changes 
0.x.x means *nothing* is stable 
## express.static
Ex: app.use(express.static('./public')); 
Defines directory to use as **document root** Will try to match paths and files from requests 
To paths and files in that directory Often more complicated than this 
Handle other Operating Systems Allow starting "from" different directories 


A GET request 
Sends all data in the URL Should not cause the server to change data 
Searches, reads
 A POST request (from HTML form) 
Sends data in the **body of the request** Can cause the server to change data 
Updates, data entry, etc 

## Response Methods
res.redirect() we've seen res.status() sends a status code 
Defaults to 200 if you don't use 
Does NOT complete response Remember response structure and order 
one status line (first) headers body 
res.send() sends body content Content is a string 
Not a rendered page, just text 



Get request and Post request

get. Request to read or get data from server
Send form field in url

Post can change server data
Send form data in request body
Can hardcore query params in action url
