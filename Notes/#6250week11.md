## What is a "proxy"?
**Proxy** - A server that forwards requests/responses 
If you send requests to a proxy 
You will get responses backJust as if you are talking to the actual server Proxy passes requests/responses between you 

## How are Proxies used in WebDev?
Proxies are used in MANY places 
**Load balancing proxies** spread server load **Forwarding proxy** for servers hides internal config
**Debugging proxies** let you inspect/alter traffic Concept is used many places 

## Setup
Create new package using Vite 
       npm create vite MY-APP -- --template react
**Please** don't call your app "MY-APP" Enter new folder 
cd MY-APP 
Install any server-side libraries 
       npm install express
May also involve cookie-parser, uuid, etc 

In most situations there would be separate folders and ==separate package.json files== for the client app and the services server 

## Flow of our Proxy
Browser requests /api/simple from Dev Server Dev Server sends request to Express Server Express Server responds to Dev ServerDev Server responds to Browser 





## What about Production?
Proxying works for us in Development What about our final production build? Use npm run build 
Creates front end in dist/ We want server to serve those files 
Add a static document root to server.js ==app.use(express.static('./dist'));== 
NOT ./public! 




useEffect() is passed a callbackcallback runs *after* the component renders 
**useEffect callback called on every rerender**
