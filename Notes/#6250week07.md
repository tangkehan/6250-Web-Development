#### Source Maps
Transpiling/minifying creates "sourcemap" files 
Tells debuggers how to relate result to original 
==when people run some wrong in one version, we can translate it==

**Starting a new package** 
```
mkdir demo
cd demo
npm init -y
npm install express
mkdir public
```

## Babel
Babel is the most common JS Transpiler 
Allows for modern development without requiring user updates 



```
mkdir demo-babel
cd demo-babel
npm init -y
npm install express
npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/cli
npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-env core-js

```

## Creating "source" files
The files you develop on are **input** to babel 
We will use src/ 
Put demo.js into src/ (**NOT** **public/**) 
Babel will **output** the files for use 
We will use public/Put index.html and demo.css to public/ 
What is the difference... 
Between static html, css, and JS files? Between src/ and public/Which will be the webserver document root?

An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined.

**Rendering the data attribute** 
``` 
<li
        class="todo ${doneClass}"
        data-index="${index}"
> 
```

## Reading the .dataset property
The data- name we choose is up to usWe use data-index since our state is an array 
For objects we'd have the key
